I'm a-gamblin', gamble all over town
I'm a-gamblin', I gamble all over town
Yeah, where I meet with a deck of cards
Boy, you know I lay my money down
I remember I was shootin' dice
Couldn't make a point to save my life
I was shootin' dice
Couldn't make a point to save my life
Yes, and I caught a four, I betted all my money
And I jumped in a door, door twicе
When a man losеs money gamblin'
After he lose he don't feel so well
When a man loses money gamblin'
After he lose he don't feel so well
'Cause he don't know when he's gonna get no more money
Take God in Heaven to tell
Lost all my money
My wife and kid was cryin' for bread
All my money
Wife and kid was cryin' for bread
I was even out of doors
Nowhere to lay my worried head
Man get unlucky, you know
You know he's bound to lose
Man get unlucky
You know man is bound to lose
You know he never gets ahold of nothin'
In this big world he may choose
Dirty buddy told nappy chin
Keep on bettin'
Boy, you know you bound to win
Dirty buddy told nappy chin
Keep on bettin', you bound to win
That is the reason I started my gamblin'
Started gamblin' all over again
